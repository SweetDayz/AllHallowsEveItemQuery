Her family treated her like a slave, her friends used her to get what they wanted and the townsfolk treated her like a burden. She was a curse and everybody believed it, yet still she pressed on to be happy. The woman had done nothing wrong in her life. Her torment continued for untold years before she met a strange man who treated her as an equal and as a lover. They spent many months together and the woman felt truly happy. But nothing lasts forever. The looks and personalities of the mortal races are cruel and vile. The man was married to another, he claimed he had been possessed by the witch and made to do horrible things at her beck and call. The woman was unfairly tried as a witch and sentenced to death by hanging. All found her guilty without any proof. As she stood atop her wooden stage she looked around at the faces she thought would mourn her, but she only saw smiles and grins. The townsfolk had plotted her demise from the beginning. As the rope was drawn and the life slowly squeezed from her lungs, her final shred of humanity snapped. Mustering her remaining breath she fought back her tears as the rage filled up inside her. She cursed. She cursed the town. She cursed the people around her. She cursed her parents, her siblings, and her fake lover. She cursed the ground they stood on, she cursed the air they breathed. She cursed and cursed and cursed until finally she cursed her own name, cursed her own very existence. The town was swallowed whole…” \nThat’s odd. The rest of the pages appear to be missing.

The inside of the hat is 10 inches across and lined with a crimson red silken fabric that for some reason looks tangled and scrunched up. The top hat is actually a portal that leads to a sub dimension much like a coat of many pockets. The sub dimension can hold up to 250 lbs as long as it can fit through the opening of the hat. The Hat always weighs 5 lbs regardless of how much is in it. Unlike other sub dimensions, the one inside the top hat naturally contains air and creatures can breathe safely even when placed inside the sub dimension. Ripping apart, destroying or placing the top hat inside another sub dimension will cause a portal to the astral plane to appear, consuming anything within 5 feet of it and vaporising the item."

Licky Licky gave Orr Orr his first job. Orr Orr watches the holes while Ali Ali is busy helping Willy Willy do important stuffs with the heart. Oh Orr Orr not meant to talk about the heart. Licky Licky would dissect Orr Orr heh heh…”\nTorn Mag #5 – Laciana “...What a strange question indeed. My children are what drive my ambitions. If not for the need to feed their thousands of hungry mouths that I oh so adore, I would have no need of the political puppets in this backwater hell hole. Without my ambitions those fools could never hold onto their power. I am the mastermind, but I am a mother foremost.”\nTorn Mag #6 – Lazarak “…My master was something of a genius, at least that’s what a gathered after I had time to digest him. After all he did get what he wanted and nobody in the entire town would stop him from winning first place that year. Of course I don’t feel bad for eating him, he squashed so many more of my siblings. Although I must admit my family does make a pretty mean soup. You should try it.”\nTorn Mag #7 – Oleg “...Now was that ribs or chops you wanted with those thighs? What? Oh right my apologies. Business has never been better, plenty of fresh meat for the chopping the block around here these days. The clientele has even improved. No I mean they stopped asking questions. Like you should.”\nTorn Mag #8 – Asteroth (Spoke to the corpse) “...This is really why you brought me back? Some age old drama. Grow up. The people didn’t care then and they still don’t care now. If anything they are all in debt to me. Look at them and how the revel in the light of their true selves without inhibition. All of them got their wish and you want to drudge up gossip about my ex-wife? Go talk to her and let me sleep for once.”\nTorn Mag #9 – Lorne “...Now look here youngling. I’ve been here longer than most of these drab scabs and you know what makes everything get along smoothly. Minding yer own damn business. You think these perfect little town runs on the good will of the people? Everyone playing along nicely, the perfect little visage of a small rural town. If you did believe that you’d be deader than I am. But my tomb would still be better than yours.”\nTorn Mag #10 – Alabaster Sisters “...The town wasn’t always fond of us. A fool left Aqua in a blizzard once. An envious troll tried to burn Amber once. And a being of science tried to electrocute Amethyst once. Many weren’t fond of us. But they always needed us, came to us, and wanted us to help. So yes they didn’t like us, but they didn’t like her more.\nTorn Mag #11 – Lucas (Bound by Silver) “...It’s really not safe to be around me you know. Full moon all night every night kind of makes the job permanent. Plenty of fools taking the wrong path in need of a guiding hand through the forest…”\nTorn Mag #12 – Orisa “...It was succulent and sweet before. But now even just the barest drop fills me with a multitude of sensations that I can’t help but drink my full.
